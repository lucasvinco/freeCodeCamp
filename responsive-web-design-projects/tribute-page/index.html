                        <h3>Here's a time line of Linus Torvalds life:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                In <strong>1991</strong>, he purchased the Intel 80386-based IBM PC and obtained a MINIX operating system. With this, he began to work and research on the Linux operating system.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                In <strong>1996</strong>, he went on a visit to the technology firm, ‘Transmeta’, where he began to work from the following year. He later worked for the Open Source Development Labs.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                From <strong>1997</strong> to <strong>1999</strong>, he worked on the '86open' project, which is a binary file format for the ‘Unix’ and Unix-like operating systems. They were to be used on a common x86 PC.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In <strong>1999</strong>, he was offered stock options for his creation by the companies, Red Hat and VA Linux. That very year, the stock prices increased to about $20 million after the companies went public.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In June <strong>2004</strong>, along with his family, he relocated to Beaverton, Oregon, where Open Source Development Labs was headquartered. The following year, he developed the software, ‘Git’.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                By <strong>2006</strong>, about two per cent of the Linux kernel was written by him, which was a significant contribution.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In <strong>2012</strong>, he stated that his contribution to the Linux kernel mostly involved merging codes that were already written by others and did not involve much programming.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
